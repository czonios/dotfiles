### fzf

fzf is a fuzzy finder. It can be used as a command `:FZF` however I have remapped it to `fzf` and it will open in the current directory.

- `fzf` turn it on
- Ctrl-P previous entry
- Ctrl-N next entry
- :Files [PATH] find in files in specific path
- :Buffers find in open buffers
- :Ag [PATTERN] run ag
- :Rg [PATTERN] run rg
